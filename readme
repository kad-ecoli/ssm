This is SSM, as described in

Krissinel, E., and K. Henrick. 
"Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast 
protein structure alignment in three dimensions." 
Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography
60.12 (2004): 2256-2268.

The main program is "ssm", which is based on the "superpose" test suite
from the Eugene Krissinels macromolecular coordinate superposition library.
The original distribution is created by Morten Kjeldgaard, Sep. 2007.
This modified distribution is created from the ssm-1.1
(https://launchpad.net/ssm) and mmdb-1.25.6.1 (https://launchpad.net/mmdb)
by Chengxin Zhang in Dec 2017 to minimize dependency.

See the file COPYING for details on the conditions under which the library
is distributed.
